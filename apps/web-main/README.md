# Web Main App

This is the main web app for 84000 Studio. It is
build using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and uses the [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/)
collaborative text editor.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies. Since this is a monorepo, node modules are installed
in the root directory. Then you can run the site locally.

```bash
npm install
npx nx dev web-main
```
