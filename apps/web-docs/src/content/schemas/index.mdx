# Schemas

How data is represented and stored is of great importance to 84000. The long trajectory of the mission means that each generation of technologist must think not only about the structure and optimization of their immediate work, but how their work can be interpreted and migrated by the next generation.

The first generation of 84000 schemas was based on **Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standards**. This was an important and critical milestone for 84000 as it captured essential textual features required to produce an accurate and accessible translation.

The next generation here is based on web standards more generally. Relational models are created so that relational data with a focus on separating data from presentation more robustly can reliably capture the vast network of textual relationships present in the Tibetan Tengyur. In other words, to improve data integrity. The second goal is to modernize the platform so that a broader community of technologists can contribute.
