"""
A hierarchical entry in a work's table of contents.

This is a recursive type - each entry can contain nested children entries.
Due to GraphQL's explicit nesting requirement, queries must specify the
desired depth using fragments.

Example query for 3 levels deep:
  fragment TocFields on TocEntry {
    uuid
    content
    label
    level
  }

  query {
    work(uuid: "...") {
      toc {
        frontMatter {
          ...TocFields
          children {
            ...TocFields
            children {
              ...TocFields
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

Maximum query depth is limited to 12 levels.
